This study creates a dataset that can be used to understand how individual differences in reading and speech relate to specific cognitive skills, personality mental health.

### Background

Prior work suggests that individuals with the temperament type known as “behavioral inhibition” are more likely to develop social anxiety if they also demonstrate particular profiles of cognitive control abilities (White et al., 2011; Buzzell et al., 2020). However it remains unclear how much these associations depend on social observation. Additionally, it remains unclear if these associations depend on the temperament of the individual, other personality or social factors, or are present for the majority of individuals with social anxiety. There is at least some work suggesting links between some forms of cognitive control (e.g., error monitoring) and social anxiety are influenced by social observation (Buzzell et al., 2017).

More generally, there is little work investigating the effect of social observation on relations between social anxiety and more ecologically valid measures of cognitive control (e.g., cognitive control during speech and reading). The current study aims to not only close these gaps in the literature, but also provide a broader investigation of how particular cognitive abilities, and personality or social factors, relate to mental health outcomes and real-world scenarios. Towards these ends, participants will perform a reading aloud task twice, once while alone and once while being observed by the experimenter. Additionally, the participants will complete a set of traditional cognitive control tasks (flanker task, dimensional change card sort task, n-back task). Task development was based on the modification of existing paradigms. Participants will also complete a more general battery of questionnaires to assess their thoughts and feelings before and after completing the tasks. 


### Major Goals

In the broader sense, this study aims to:
- Understand how individual differences in reading and speech behaviors relate to particular cognitive abilities, personality and social factors.
- Understand how individual differences in reading and speech behaviors relate to mental health outcomes such as social anxiety.

More specifically, this study aims to:
- Determine whether individuals with social anxiety change their behavior (accuracy and response time) after making errors on simple computer tasks and ecologiligally-valid reading environments in similar ways. And, whether such changes depend on whether the individual is being observed or not.
- Determine whether the association between specific executive functions (tasks switching, inhibitory control, and working memory) and social anxiety depends on social observation and/or the temperament of the individual.
