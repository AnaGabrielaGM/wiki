*Not the FIU cluster*

## Overview
The [FIU High-performance computing (HPC) cluster](http://ircc.fiu.edu/) is a group of interconnected computers designed to perform computationally expensive tasks. This includes processing and storing large quantities of data, executing programs in parallel, and running automated actions that assist in the research process.

Listed below are contents that detail how to access and properly utilize this resource. Prior to use, lab members must be [onboarded to the HPC](https://ndclab.github.io/wiki/docs/Onboarding/accessing-hpc.html) by the lab manager.

## Data and Analysis
The HPC contains de-identified data for NDCLab projects that are currently in data collection or data analysis. It also contains our scripts that enable manipulation of that data, for example to preprocess it or analyze it.

## Applications
The [Instructional and Research Computing Center (IRCC) group](https://ircc.fiu.edu/) manages the FIU HPC. They install all programs, such as RStudio and MATLAB. As a lab, however, we can install packages that are used by those applications.
