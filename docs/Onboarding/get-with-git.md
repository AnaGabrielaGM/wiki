# Get with Git
1. Find your [shell](https://ndclab.github.io/wiki/docs/technical-docs/shell.html).

2. Install git on your local machine. [This page](https://ndclab.github.io/wiki/docs/technical-docs/git_and_github.html) includes instructions for macOS, Windows, and Linux/Unix installations. At minimum, read the first five sections before you continue: Overview, Opening a Shell, Installing Git, Setting up SSH Keys, and Basic Commands.

3. [Sign up](https://github.com) for a free GitHub account.

4. Set up your identity by typing two commands into your shell:
`$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"`
`$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com`
(Obviously, replace John Doe and johndoe@example.com with your actual name and your actual e-mail. If you're not sure whether you've done this before, check with the command `git config --list`.)

Start with [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVRQoVRzMIY) by Tech With Tim, which offers a broad overview of Git and GitHub while showing you both the command line interface and the GitHub interface. Do not worry about digesting *everything* that he shows in this video, but rather focus on learning the big picture lessons: key terminology, core concepts, and the commands he uses most frequently.
