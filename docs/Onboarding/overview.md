# Overview
Following a successful interview, a new lab member will be invited to join the NDCLab as an "intern" or a "volunteer." These terms refer to unpaid individuals involved in study or non-study activities within the lab. "Interns" are current university (or MDCPS school) students or recent grads. "Volunteers" are individuals who are not affiliated with any university.

The various onboarding steps are outlined below. Some must be completed by the incoming lab member while others are completed by the lab manager or PI. The incoming lab member should, however, be proactive wherever possible and should not hesitate to follow up with the lab manager if they have questions about their onboarding status.


## CCF Access
1. Intern application: The incoming lab member must complete Form (A) of the FIU Intern Application-Applicant Form or the FIU Volunteer Applications-Applicant Form, as appropriate. Send to **ndclab@fiu.edu** with a scan of their Panther ID.
2. Person-of-interest (POI) request: The lab manager submits the intern application to the CCF, then completes a POI request. This triggers the CCF to initiate a background check for the incoming lab member.
3. Background check: The incoming lab member should watch their inbox (and spam box) carefully for the authorization request. Details on the authorization request are available [here](link).
4. CITI training: After completing the application, the incoming member should immediately begin working on the [required CITI training courses](link).

## Lab Access
1. Slack: The lab manager will send the incoming member an invite to join the NDCLab Slack workspace.
2. Lab meeting: The lab manager will send the incoming member an invite to join the weekly lab meeting, held on Zoom.
3. Google Drive: The lab manager will send the incoming member an invite to access the lab's Google Drive folder.
4. FIU HPC: The lab manager will request HPC access for the incoming lab member. The incoming lab member should schedule a time to attend the [HPC Onboarding training](link).
5. GitHub
6. ZenHub


## Project Access
Once the incoming lab member has been onboarded to the CCF and the lab at large, the lab manager will introduce the newest member to their assigned project lead, who will coordinate access to:
1. Sona
2. RedCap
