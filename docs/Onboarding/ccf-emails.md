# CCF Emails

## Volunteer Contact Form
Once your background check is complete, the CCF will send you an e-mail to complete the CCF onboarding process. A link at the bottom of this e-mail allows you to:
* complete your emergency contact information for the CCF
* sign a Code of Conduct
* attach the two CCF-required [CITI course certificates](https://ndclab.github.io/wiki/docs/Onboarding/certifications.html)
* attach a copy of your Panther ID or driver's license<br/>
