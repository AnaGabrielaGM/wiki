# CCF Emails

## Volunteer Contact Form
Once your background check is complete, the CCF will send you an e-mail to complete the CCF onboarding process. A link at the bottom of this e-mail allows you to:
* complete your emergency contact information for the CCF
* sign a Code of Conduct
* attach the two CCF-required [CITI course certificates](https://ndclab.github.io/wiki/docs/Onboarding/certifications.html)
* attach a copy of your Panther ID or driver's license<br/>

## HIPAA Requirement
After you complete the Volunteer Contact Form and your AD account has been generated (if applicable), you will receive an e-mail from the CCF requesting that you complete a HIPAA training on develop.fiu.edu. It is important that you complete this training under the new login that you have been assigned (your AD account), not your student login. Once complete, click the link in the e-mail from the CCF to upload your certificate.

## Data Services User Agreement
Several days after you upload your HIPAA certificate, you will receive an e-mail from ccfdatasvcs@fiu.edu with a link to the "CCF Data Services User Agreement," which you need to read and sign. This is the last actionable step in the CCF onboarding process.

## RedCap Access
You will know that your onboarding is complete when you receive an e-mail informing you that you have been granted access to REDCap.
