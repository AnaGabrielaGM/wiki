## Accessing AD Account Through Microsoft Outlook
Upon receiving login credentials to your FIU employee account the default method to access this inbox will be through Microsoft Outlook and NOT Gmail as previously available for FIU student email accounts.

1. Visit (https://outlook.office.com) and click **"Sign In"** to enter your email address.
2. Upon entering your email address you will be redirected to FIU's Outlook login and there it well ask for your email address and password.
3. Upon entering your email address and password it will send you to FIU's Two Factor Authenticator which will prompt you to verify your authenticity in a variety of ways, either on the DUO app, text, or call.
4. After choosing the method you will use it will ask you to choose between two accounts, your student account, and your employee account.
5. After choosing your **employee account** a prompt will appear that you now have access to the account and you will be able to access the inbox on Outlook.

## Importance of The AD Account
In this inbox you will receive emails necessary to continue onboarding like verifying your REDCap account, and other important emails from the CCF. So **Check Regularly**.
