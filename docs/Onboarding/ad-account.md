## What is an AD Account
This is an alternative to your FIU student account, used for volunteers, interns, and employees.  It will look like an FIU login, but without any numbers. You can use your AD account to log in to e-mail and Zoom. It will also become your login information for REDCap and accessing the lab workstations.


## How Do I Know if I Have an AD Account?
Everyone receives an AD account once employed, so if you had an on-campus job before, you almost certainly have an AD account.  To check:
1. Go to account.fiu.edu.
2. Log in.
2. Scroll down until you find the "Email" section.
3. Review all your FIU usernames.  If there is one without any numbers, that is your AD account.


## Accessing Your AD Account Through Microsoft Outlook
Upon receiving login credentials to your FIU employee/AD account, the default method to access this inbox will be through Microsoft Outlook and NOT Gmail as previously available for FIU student email accounts.

1. Visit (https://outlook.office.com) and click **"Sign In"** to enter your email address.
2. Upon entering your email address, you will be redirected to FIU's Outlook login; it will ask for your email address and password.
3. Upon entering your email address and password, it will send you to FIU's Two Factor Authenticator, which will prompt you to verify your authenticity in a variety of ways: DUO app, text, or call.
4. After authentication, it will ask you to choose between two accounts: your student account and your employee/AD account.
5. After choosing your **employee account**, a prompt will appear that you now have access to the account and you will be able to access the inbox on Outlook.

For those who have not used Outlook before, [here](https://https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/basic-tasks-in-outlook-192eb102-2ee2-4049-b7f5-aa0eb4231fbb) is a basic users guide to get you started.


## Importance of Your AD Account
In this inbox you will receive emails necessary to continue the CCF onboarding process, such as verifying your REDCap account. So **check regularly**.
