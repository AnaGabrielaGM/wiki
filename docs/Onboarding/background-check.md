# Background Check
All members of the NDCLab are required to complete a background check as part of their onboarding to the FIU Center for Children and Families (CCF).

Approximately one week after your application form is submitted to the CCF, you will receive two e-mails from volunteers@fiu.edu. The first informs you that a DocuSign is being sent:

![background-check-email](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NDCLab/wiki/main/docs/_assets/onboarding/background-check-email.png)

The second is the DocuSign itself. Keep a careful eye on your inbox and your spam/junk folder.

![docusign](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NDCLab/wiki/main/docs/_assets/onboarding/docusign.png)

(If you already have an FIU AD account from a prior internship or employment, then you also have an FIU e-mail address without any numbers in it. All CCF correspondence is likely to go to this e-mail address.)

The e-mail will take you to a DocuSign form:

When completing this form, use the following:<br/>
**Reason for clearance:** Conduct research with minors and/or vulnerable people<br/>
**Department:** Center for Children and Families
