## Overview
When we run participants, we are representing the lab, CCF, and the university. We want to have a good reputation so participants continue to run in our studies. Additionally, consistent professional behavior will help ensure high data quality. Keep in mind the overall lab's [community standards,](https://ndclab.github.io/wiki/docs/around-the-lab/community-standards.html) [roles, and expectations.](https://ndclab.github.io/wiki/docs/around-the-lab/roles-expectations.html)

## Code of Conduct
### High Data Quality
* Maintain a high ethical standard- never fabricate or compromise data
* Bring up concerns, questions, and potential errors with study lead/PI as soon as possible
* Keep detailed notes about occurrences that may affect the data in the appropriate study tracker
* Never rename, overwrite, move, or delete files without checking with study lead/PI first
* Know and understand the protocol- all RAs are responsible for knowing the protocol, regardless of seniority or experimenter role

### Professionalism
* Always keep language and discussion topics appropriate when working with participants or in the CCF
* Wear clothes that adhere to the [community standards,](https://ndclab.github.io/wiki/docs/around-the-lab/community-standards.html) when running participants
* Participant comfort is paramount- make sure the participant is not experiencing any discomfort and remember that the participant can leave at any time (be careful not to use coercive language to get them to stay)

### General Expectations
* Arrive on time consistently to meetings and EEG sessions- Arrive 30 minutes before the participant arrives to set up equipment and expect to stay 20-40 minutes after participant to help with cleanup
* Check slack regularly and attend EEG meetings
* Treat the equipment carefully and with respect 
* Open and frequent communication about availability and changes to schedule
* Let the EEG lab manager know if there are low supplies (towels, gel, etc.) or if there are issues with the equipment
* Utilize EEG use log every EEG session or training
