### What is Expected from All Lab Members
You are now a lifelong member of the NDCLab and future lab alumni. The success of each member of the lab or team of lab members is the success of the NDCLab as a whole. When one person or group publishes a great paper, it shows anyone else in the lab can do the same. If one lab member is accepted into a top-tier PhD program or lands a dream industry job, it shows that others can come through the NDCLab and do the same. With each individual success of the lab, the more the lab gains prestige and this increases the value of your membership because letters of recommendation from the Lab Director will carry more weight.

* Learn from and with each other.
* Mentor and help one another.
* Support and lift each other up.
* Do your part to create a culture of open communication.
* Open with your own strengths and weaknesses.
* Pre-empt potential conflicts through open dialogue.
* Be accountable for the tasks you say you will accomplish, and complete them when you say you will.
* Be honest and open about roadblocks or challenges that may cause delays.
* Respond to labmates in a timely manner.

### What to Expect from the Lab Director
**Lab Level**
* Ensure that the NDC Lab remains a positive, inclusive and supportive environment where we can:
  * “Do great science that is fascinating at a basic level, but has enormous applied value to society as well”.
  * “Improve and develop our own skills and knowledge”.
* Set the larger research agenda and priorities for the lab.
* Ensure the lab has the people and resources it needs to run smoothly and achieve our goals.
* Foster collaboration, communication, and celebrate differences.
* Communicate the larger context of any given task.
* Remove roadblocks to execute tasks in line with your/lab’s priorities.
* Operate honestly and transparently.

**Individual Level**
* For those that remain committed to the lab, you can expect the lab director to remain committed to you for life.
* Match your strengths and skills to impactful roles and experiences.
* Recognize your contributions (did someone say “authorship?”).
* Provide mentorship/connections to help you navigate academia or a non-academic career.
* Provide direct, one-on-one theoretical, technical, and practical training where appropriate. (*But also*: point you in the right direction to facilitate your “learning how to learn” where appropriate.)
* Motivate you when you lose sight of the bigger picture. (*But also*: have frank conversations about the diversity of academic/career paths possible.)

### What to Expect from the Lab Manager and Lab Tech
As support staff for the lab, the Lab Manager and Lab Technician should ensure that the lab is organized, operating smoothly, and a positive place to work.
