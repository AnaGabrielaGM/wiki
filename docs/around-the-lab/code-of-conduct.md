## Overview
We are here to [do great science and develop our skills](https://ndclab.github.io/wiki/docs/welcome/lab-culture.html). These goals require us to work together, collaboratively and as a community, in order to be more than the sum of our parts. This page outlines our core values and how we can each contribute to building this community.

## Our Values
### Openness
* We seek to be open-minded and curious. This means we listen to new ideas, celebrate differences, and operate with humility.
* We believe in open, transparent, and reproducible science, and we demonstrate these beliefs in the honest and transparent way that we conduct our work.

### Accountability
* We operate with integrity in order to merit the trust of our colleagues, protect the rights of our participants, and uphold public trust in science.
* We fulfill the promises we make to one another.

### Respect
* We demonstrate professionalism in all our interactions with colleagues, participants, and administrators to acknowledge the value of their time and contributions.
* We are responsive to one another, both in the timeliness of our replies and the quality of our responses.
* We offer suggestions and feedback in a constructive manner that makes clear our supportive intentions.

## How We Participate in this Community
The NDCLab is created by the actions and contributions of each member of the lab and, likewise, each member's conduct reflects back on the lab. We are only as strong as each of our members and therefore must commit to learning together, mentoring one another, and lifting one another up. We contribute to this lab's community by:
* Bringing our best to each activity we undertake
* Embodying the lab's values in all our actions (described above)
* Fulfilling the [expectations established for all lab members](https://ndclab.github.io/wiki/docs/around-the-lab/roles-expectations.html)

## Grounds For Dismissal From the Lab
It is not fair for one lab member, in failing to live up to our community standards, to decrease the value and enjoyment of the lab for others. As a result, members may be dismissed from the lab for:
* A general and pernicious lack of professionalism in public-facing roles.
* Intentional violations of trust, such as: falsifying data, lying, plagiarism of any kind, intentionally withholding the full truth, actions or words that detract from a positive/inclusive environment, etc. Any suspected violation of trust should be [immediately reported](https://ndclab.github.io/wiki/docs/around-the-lab/report-concerns.html).
* Consistent or repetitive failure to uphold these values and meet the [expectations set for all lab members](https://ndclab.github.io/wiki/docs/around-the-lab/roles-expectations.html).
