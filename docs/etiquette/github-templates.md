## Overview

There are two template repositories available in GitHub for the launching of new projects. Before using these templates, ensure that you have approval from the lab director to open a new project. Each lab project requires time and resources, so the balance across the lab must be carefully maintained to ensure that each project is a success.

## Setting Up a New Project

### GitHub

1. Start with [brainBox](https://github.com/NDCLab/brainBox)

This is where all great ideas get incubated. If you believe that the brainBox process is not appropriate for your idea, talk to the lab manager before creating any new repository on GitHub.

2. When you get the green-light from the PI, create a new repo using the appropriate template repository:

**research projects:** https://github.com/NDCLab/template-tool
**tool development:** https://github.com/NDCLab/template-project

To use a template repository, simply select

3. Create dev branch

4. Add branch protection rules

5. Update settings to delete head branches

6. Draft the readme file that provides a roadmap to guide the development of your project.
- Every repository should have a succinct `readme.md` file that guides development and points to relevant data.
even when nothing else posted to main, a general roadmap should be available in the readme that redirects visitors over to dev to see the magic in progress

MAIN/DEV readme
what is the project
who is on the project
blurb to check out dev for work-in-progress
details for what is actually in main
roadmap for the project
refer to the contributing doc

### ZenHub


3. Plan all project releases and create the corresponding ZenHub Epics.
4. Plan all project issues (which may be large and abstract at this stage) and assign them to the appropriate Epic.
5. Organize the Project Backlog pipeline in ZenHub by putting the earliest Epic at the top, followed by its associated issues in priority order. This is followed by the next earliest Epic with its issues, and so on.
6. Launch the first Epic by moving the "Epic" issue and its associated issues to the Release Backlog in ZenHub.

8. Set up your sprints inside ZenHub and plan your first sprint meeting with your team!

## ZenHub

(add instructions for setting up a workspace, including customizing pipelines)
create new workspace, following naming conventions, connect repository
customize pipelines based on zenhub.md table

(add instructions for connecting a new repo to an existing workspace)

create zenhub workspace
establish epics and add to zenhub
fill project backlog with issues (everything we ever hope to accomplish with this project)
move issues that will be completed for first release into the Release Backlog
