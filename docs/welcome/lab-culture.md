### Why are we here?
Our lab has two primary goals:
1. To do great science that is fascinating at a basic level, but has enormous applied value to society as well
2. To improve and develop our own skills and knowledge.

### Research Agenda
The research agenda of the NDCLab focuses on cognitive control, guided by three interrelated questions:
  1. What is cognitive control (across three levels of analysis)?
  2. How does cognitive control develop (across adolescence)?
  3. How does cognitive control relate to social behavior and social anxiety?
