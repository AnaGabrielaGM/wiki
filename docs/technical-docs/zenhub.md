## Overview

ZenHub is a plug-in for your browser that connects to GitHub. It offers [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board)-style boards, called a "workspaces," which the NDCLab uses to visually manage projects.  When an issue is created inside GitHub, it automatically appears on the "New" pipeline on an associated ZenHub workspace. In general, each repository is connected to one workspace, but it is possible to connect multiple repositories in special circumstances where this would be beneficial to project management.

## Installing

1. Before you install ZenHub, [get yourself with git](https://ndclab.github.io/wiki/docs/Onboarding/get-with-git.html). It is important that you are already a member of the NDCLab organization on GitHub before you install the ZenHub extension.
2. Download the ZenHub extension, which is currently available for Chrome and Firefox. You can do this directly from the browser extension store or using the [link available from ZenHub](https://help.zenhub.com/support/solutions/articles/43000507578-installing-the-zenhub-extension-for-cloud).
3. During this process, you will need to authorize ZenHub to see your personal and organization repositories.
4. After installing, you'll probably find yourself within the ZenHub app. Some lab members prefer to operate in this interface, but you will want to hop back over to GitHub to get your bearings first.
5. Now, on GitHub, using the same browser to which you installed ZenHub, you should see the "ZenHub" tab within each NDCLab repository.
